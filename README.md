# 🗄️ CodeVault

### Your entire coding journey — unified, organized, and automated.

CodeVault brings every competitive‑programming platform you use into **one dashboard**, and automatically publishes your accepted solutions to a **clean, searchable GitHub repository** — no browser extension, no copy‑pasting code for every problem.

## 👥 Team Git Workflow (single `main` branch)

> Two developers build CodeVault in parallel — one owns the **frontend**, the other owns the **backend**. Everyone works directly on the **`main` branch**. To avoid conflicts, each developer only edits their own folders.

**Who owns what**

| Role | Folders they edit |
|------|-------------------|
| **Frontend dev** | `web-frontend/`, `frontendHtml/` |
| **Backend dev** | `web-backend/`, `git-service/` |

**How to use these commands:** run them in your terminal from inside the `CodeVault/` folder. Always **pull before you start** and **pull again before you push** so you never overwrite the other dev's work.

**1. One-time setup — clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gaurav06120714/CodeVault.git
cd CodeVault
```

**2. Before you start working — get the latest code**
```bash
git pull origin main
```

**3. Save your work (commit)**
```bash
git status                 # see what changed
git add .
git commit -m "add auth routes"
```

**4. Pull the other dev's changes, then push yours**
```bash
git pull --rebase origin main   # get their latest work on top of yours
git push origin main            # send your work to GitHub
```

**If you get a merge conflict** (rare — each dev owns different folders)
```bash
# open the file, fix the <<<<<<< ======= >>>>>>> markers, then:
git add <file>
git rebase --continue
git push origin main
```

**✅ Golden rules**
- Always `git pull origin main` before you start work.
- Always `git pull --rebase origin main` right before you `git push`.
- Commit small and often with clear messages.
- Stay in your own folders (frontend vs backend) to avoid conflicts.

## 🧩 What is CodeVault?

When you solve problems on LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, or HackerRank, all that hard work stays trapped — split across different sites, hidden behind logins, and impossible to show off in one place.

**CodeVault fixes that.** It delivers **two separate things**:

1. 🌐 **An analytics website** — your own page that pulls **public stats** from every platform into one place, showing your *total* analysis across all of them. It can be viewed privately on your dashboard and shared publicly by username (`/u/your-name`), like a coding profile.
2. 📦 **An auto‑synced GitHub repo** — your **accepted solutions** are automatically organized into a GitHub repo with an auto‑generated index, so anyone (a recruiter, a friend, or future‑you) can search a problem and instantly see how you solved it.

> These two are independent: the website works from a **username alone** (stats), while the code repo needs a **one‑time connect** (your private solution code).

> 📌 This repository is a **monorepo skeleton** — the full folder structure with an empty file for every planned module. Code is added module‑by‑module. The READMEs are the single source of truth for the architecture.

---

## 🗂 Monorepo layout

CodeVault is split into **three independent applications** — one UI and two separate backends:

### How they connect

The **web‑frontend talks to both backends** directly over REST:

```
web-frontend ──REST──▶ web-backend   (auth, stats, public profiles)
             └─REST──▶ git-service   (sync solution code to GitHub)
```

- The **web‑backend** powers the analytics website (works from a **username alone**).
- The **git‑service** is a dedicated, separate backend for GitHub sync (needs the **one‑time connect**), so syncing scales and fails independently of the website.

---

## ✨ Core features

- 📊 **Unified analytics dashboard** — every platform in one view: total solved, difficulty & topic breakdown, language usage, streaks, rankings, activity heatmap, and progress over time.
- 🔄 **Auto‑sync to GitHub** — the moment you solve a problem, it is pushed to your linked repo as a **folder named by its problem number**, holding the **question** and your **answer**, plus an auto‑updated README index.
- 🔐 **Connect once, automate forever** — authorize a platform a single time; syncing then runs on a schedule.
- 🧩 **Cross-browser extension (Path B v2)** — captures *your own* accepted solutions in the browser as you solve them and feeds the sync engine, signed in as the **same CodeVault user** (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Firefox; Safari later).
- 🤖 **(Planned) AI layer** — auto‑explain solutions, auto‑tag problem type, recommend the next problem by your weakest topic.

---

## 📂 How your synced repo looks

When you solve a problem, CodeVault auto‑commits it to your linked repo (for example `LeetCodeQuestions`). **Each problem becomes a folder named by its problem number**, containing both the **question** and your **answer**:

```
LeetCodeQuestions/
├── README.md                  # auto-generated index of every solved problem
├── 0001/
│   ├── question.md            # the problem statement
│   └── solution.py            # your accepted solution
├── 0369/
│   ├── question.md
│   └── solution.cpp
└── 0704/
    ├── question.md
    └── solution.java
```

- **Folder name = problem number** (zero‑padded) so problems sort naturally.
- `question.md` — the problem statement: title, difficulty, topic tags, link, and description.
- `solution.<ext>` — your accepted code, in the language you solved it in.
- The top‑level `README.md` is an auto‑updated table indexing every solved problem.

> So when someone searches "LeetCode 369", they land on `0369/` and instantly see the question **and** exactly how you solved it.

---

## 🧠 How it works — the two data paths

CodeVault is built on one key insight: **public stats and private source code are two different kinds of data**, so they travel two independent paths. If one breaks, the other still works.

### Path A — Statistics *(username only)*
- **Input:** a public username / profile link.
- **Source:** public endpoints (LeetCode GraphQL, Codeforces official API…).
- **Auth:** none. Always available, fully legal .

### Path B — Code sync *(one‑time authorized connect)*
- **Input:** an authorized session you grant **once** per platform.
- **Source:** *your own* accepted submissions, including source code.
- **Auth:** required once — syncing is automatic thereafter.
- **Path B v2 (browser extension):** the cleaner alternative — because you're already signed in to the platform in your own browser, the extension captures your accepted code at solve-time and feeds the sync engine. No server-side session replay. See [browser-extension/README.md](browser-extension/README.md).

```
Public username ───▶ Stats Poller ──────────▶ Unified Dashboard
One-time connect ──▶ Submission Fetcher ──▶ Organizer ──▶ GitHub API ──▶ Public Repo + README
```

> ⚠️ **Honest truth:** a username alone can fetch *stats* but **never your source code** — submitted code is private on every platform. Path B exists precisely to solve that, with your explicit consent, touching only your own data.

## 🛠 Tech stack & versions

> 📌 **Canonical source: [docs/TECH_STACK.md](docs/TECH_STACK.md).** The stack was upgraded (2026-06-28) — the table below now matches it.

| App | Technology | Version |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| web-frontend | **Next.js** (App Router) · **React** · **Tailwind CSS** · **TanStack Query** | `15.x` · `18.3.x` · `4.x` · `5.x` |
| web-backend | **Express** · **Prisma** · **Zod** | `5.x` · `5.18.x` · `3.x` |
| git-service | **Express** · **Prisma** · **node-cron** · **axios** · **BullMQ** | `5.x` · `5.18.x` · `3.x` · `1.x` · `5.x` |
| Shared | **TypeScript** · **Node.js** | `5.5.x` · `≥ 20.x LTS` |
| Database | **PostgreSQL** · **Redis** | `16.x` · `7.x` |

> Upgrades vs the original plan: Node `18.18`→`20 LTS`, Express `4.19`→`5`, Tailwind `3.4`→`4`, added TanStack Query. Rationale in [docs/TECH_STACK.md](docs/TECH_STACK.md). Per‑app details: [web-frontend/README.md](web-frontend/README.md), [web-backend/README.md](web-backend/README.md), [git-service/README.md](git-service/README.md).

## 📐 Project rules & conventions

1. **Clear separation** — UI in `web-frontend/`, website logic in `web-backend/`, GitHub sync in `git-service/`. The frontend calls both backends over REST.
2. **Each app is self‑contained** — its own `package.json`, config, and README.
3. **Two data paths stay separate** — public stats (Path A) never depend on an authorized session (Path B).
4. **Secrets only in `.env`** — never commit real tokens; each app has its own `.env.example`.
5. **Consent first** — the app only ever accesses the user's *own* data, with explicit authorization.
6. **Commit style:** small, focused commits with prefixes — `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`.
7. **Author attribution:** every commit is authored solely by the project owner — **no co‑authors**.

## ⚖️ Ethics & limitations

- CodeVault accesses **only your own data**, with your explicit authorization.
- **Source code is private on every platform** — it can never be fetched from a username alone; Path B (one‑time connect) is the only honest way to get it.
- Session tokens **expire** periodically; the app detects this and prompts a clean re‑connect while the stats dashboard keeps working.
- Uses official **GitHub OAuth / tokens** — never handles raw platform passwords.
