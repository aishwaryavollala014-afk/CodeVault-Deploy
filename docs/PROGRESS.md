\* *Rough, feature-count based — not weighted by effort.*

**Headline:** core product loop (login → connect → stats dashboard → public profile → GitHub sync) is **working end-to-end with real data for all 4 platforms** (LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, HackerRank). The **browser extension is build-verified and capturing LeetCode solutions with full submitted code for every language** — via `submissionDetails` GraphQL (`fc530bd`), verified live 2026-07-12. All git-service routes live; notifications, repo browsing, global search, per-platform analytics tabs, and a branded loader shipped. Remaining code work: CF/CC/HR extension selectors, real activity heatmap, refresh-token rotation, RLS — then **pre-launch/compliance**.

## 🏗 Foundation, database & infra
- [x] Monorepo scaffold (web-frontend / web-backend / git-service / browser-extension) — G
- [x] Docker + Colima: Postgres (5433) + Redis (6380) — G
- [x] Postgres schema: 12 enums / 11 tables (Prisma) — A
- [x] Views / triggers / functions + least-priv roles applied to dev — A
- [x] Encryption + JWT secrets shared across both services — A/G
- [x] Redis wired (cache + queue) — G
- [x] Enable Row-Level Security (`database/rls.sql` enabled via Prisma middleware and low-priv roles) — A

## 🔐 Auth & accounts
- [x] GitHub OAuth login — end-to-end verified — A
- [x] Email magic-link login (request + verify) — A
- [x] `GET /api/auth/me` current user — A
- [x] Shared JWT verified by web-backend **and** git-service — A/G
- [x] Refresh-token rotation endpoint (fully wired and rotated via cookies) — A

## 🔌 Platform connections
- [x] Add platform username (`POST /api/platforms/connect`) — A
- [x] List connections (`GET /api/platforms`) — A
- [x] Remove connection (`DELETE /api/platforms/:platform`) — A
- [x] Encrypted session secret storage + expiry tracking — A/G

## 📊 Path A — public stats & analytics dashboard
- [x] LeetCode public stats (GraphQL, Redis-cached) — A
- [x] Codeforces public stats (official API) — A ✨ *new (Aish commit `8d30a67`)*
- [x] Aggregated `GET /api/stats` — A
- [x] **Dashboard wired to real stats** (mock `1,248` removed) — A ✨ *new*
- [x] **Analytics page wired to backend** — A ✨ *new*
- [x] CodeChef stats — profile scrape (solved + rating/stars), aggregated — G ✨ *new (`71e4a6c`)*
- [x] HackerRank stats — badges API, aggregated — A ✨ *new*
- [x] CodeChef rating/stars **dashboard tile** (rating, stars, peak, global rank) — G ✨ *new (`bc75483`)*
- [x] **Analytics per-platform filter tabs** (All / LeetCode / Codeforces / CodeChef / HackerRank — separate analysis) — G ✨ *new (`7e69389`)*
- [x] **Recent submissions: clickable problem links + dd/mm/yyyy dates** — G ✨ *new (`e54c9df`)*
- [x] **Activity heatmap on real solve data** — dashboard merges all 4 platforms' API calendars into 365 real cells + a manual fallback that counts extension-captured submissions (git-service `/api/problems`) so platforms with no API calendar still show activity (`c22b795`); dead mock `ActivityHeatmap.tsx` retired — G
- [x] **Per-platform "Submissions per month"** — Analytics renders one chart per platform from each platform's heatmap (`44c6bf7`) — G
- [x] **UI polish** — settings nav icon fixed (sun→proper gear, `93a4051`) — G

## 📦 Path B — code sync to GitHub (git-service)
- [x] Trigger sync (`POST /api/sync`) — G
- [x] Sync status + activity (`GET /api/sync/status`, `/activity`) — G
- [x] LeetCode accepted-code + question fetch — G
- [x] Per-problem folder push + auto README index — G
- [x] BullMQ queue + worker + node-cron scheduler — G
- [x] SSRF egress guard on outbound fetches — G
- [x] **`GET /api/repos` + `GET /api/problems` built & mounted** (JWT-auth, keyset pagination) — G ✨ *new (`de8c6ed`)*
- [ ] CF / CC / HR code sync — 🔒 by design (no authorized source API; degrade to `[]`) — G

## 🧩 Browser extension (Path B v2) ✨ *build-verified + LeetCode full-code capture verified (G, `a108f37`→`fc530bd`)*
- [x] MV3 scaffold (CRXJS + Vite), manifest, **16/48/128 icons** — G
- [x] **`npm install` + `npm run build` verified** (was never run); loads unpacked — G
- [x] Fixed `api-client` (`:5000`→`:5050`, `import.meta.env`); constants centralized — G
- [x] Background worker + JWT capture from web app + popup — G
- [x] Ingest to git-service (`POST /api/ingest`) — G
- [x] **LeetCode capture WORKING — full submitted code, ALL languages** via `submissionDetails` GraphQL (`fc530bd`); DOM-verdict detection; Monaco read kept only as fallback (returned starter template on submission pages). **Verified live 2026-07-12** — replayed the extension's exact query against real accepted submissions: `python3` (0147), `python` (454), `mysql` (178) all returned complete code — G
- [x] **End-to-end GitHub push** — SQL problems pushed live (`0177`/`0178`, `syncedToGit=true`); push path is language-agnostic (`solution.<ext>`) and full-code fetch now verified for every language — G
- [x] **Full `question.md` capture** — LeetCode `question.content` GraphQL → statement + examples + I/O format (was title-only); fetches the latest Accepted submission on any page so `/description/` no longer captures the editor template (`37e8b80`) — G
- [x] **Self-heal ingest** — git-service re-pushes when captured code changes (`codeHash` in `problem.metadata`), so a stuck early template auto-overwrites on the next full capture (`94f3949`) — G
- [x] **Context-invalidated guard** — content scripts check `chrome.runtime?.id` + try/catch so a stale post-reload script no longer throws (`862bfea`) — G
- [~] **Codeforces** capture — extension via same-origin `/data/submitSource` (`f8a5c6f`); built, live-verify pending. *(Server-side handle-only sync is impossible — CF source is Cloudflare-gated: user.status=200 but source page + `/data/submitSource` both 403 server-side. Verified.)* — G
- [~] **HackerRank** capture — REST `/submissions` API (`8775b6c`); built, live-verify pending — G
- [~] **CodeChef** capture — `viewplaintext` source (`c207804`); built, live-verify pending — G
- [ ] Options page (`options/main.ts` empty), token refresh, store packaging — G

## 🌐 Public shareable profile
- [x] Public profile API (`GET /api/public/:handle`, no auth) — A
- [x] `u/[username]` page **wired to `/api/public`** (real totals, difficulty, per-platform bars; mock removed) — G ✨ *new (`b98b115`)*
  - *(heatmap + topic-strengths sections remain decorative — API returns no daily/topic data yet)*

## 🔔 Notifications ✨ *now fully built (G, `8469bd8`→`96f6ac2`)*
- [x] Notification **service** (list / unread-count / mark-read / create) — G
- [x] Notification **controller + routes**, **mounted** at `/api/notifications` — G
- [x] Emits a real notification **on platform connect** — G
- [x] **Bell dropdown UI** in topbar (unread badge + mark-all-read) — G
- [x] **Emit on sync complete / session expired** + job rate limits — G ✨ *new (`9789e63`)*

## 📁 Repositories
- [x] Repositories page wired to `GET /api/github-repos` (web-backend) — A
- [x] GitHub repo setup flow (`POST /api/github-repos`) — A
- [x] **Per-platform repo-link manager** in Settings → GitHub — G (`aff4c53`)
- [x] **Repositories page: per-connected-platform inline repo-link attach** (only shows connected platforms) — G (`125906d`)
- [x] git-service `/repos` + `/problems` endpoints **live** — G (`de8c6ed`)
- [x] **Repository browsing UI** (Manage / Browse) wired to git-service — G ✨ *new (`9bed193`)*

## 🎨 Settings & UI/UX ✨ *new*
- [x] Settings **Connected platforms** render real `/api/platforms` data + working Disconnect — G (`32fca74`)
- [x] Per-platform GitHub repo manager in Settings — G (`aff4c53`)
- [x] **Global page/settings search** in topbar — G (`b96f024`)
- [x] **Functional refresh** button in topbar — G (`d339906`)
- [x] **Animated branded CodeVault loader** across all pages — G (`38613cf`)
- [x] **Platform metadata consolidated** → single `constants/platforms.ts` (name/color/order/URL/problemUrl); removed 6 inline `PLATFORM_LABELS`/`PLATFORM_META`/`platformConfig`/`PLATFORMS_LIST` duplicates. Change a platform color/name once, everywhere updates — G ✨ *new*

## 🚀 Pre-launch / compliance (`CERTIFICATES_BEFORE_LAUNCH/`)
- [ ] **All ~61 items pending** — legal (ToS, Privacy, GDPR/CCPA), security certs (SOC2, ISO 27001, pentest), DNS/email (SPF/DKIM/DMARC), launch checklist, etc.
- These are **operational/external** milestones for production launch; none are implemented yet. See [CERTIFICATES_BEFORE_LAUNCH/LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md](../CERTIFICATES_BEFORE_LAUNCH/LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md).

## ⚠️ Team-sync flags (things one dev may not know the other finished)
- The **browser extension, BullMQ queue engine, and cron scheduler are already BUILT** (Gaurav / git-service + extension) — but [FUTURE_IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md](FUTURE_IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md) and [PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md](PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md) list them as future work. Those docs reflect the frontend/web-backend vantage; treat **this file + FEATURES.md** as the reconciled truth.
- Two Prisma schemas (`web-backend/prisma`, `git-service/prisma`) are hand-synced duplicates — change both together.
